    <h2>Victor Vector</h2>
    <p>
      Under the moniker <strong>Victor Vector</strong>, Matthew LaBarre uses his platform to
      advocate for disability rights, accessible housing and transparent
      governance.  Victor Vector is not only an artistic persona but also a
      legal avatar through which LaBarre represents himself (<em>pro se</em>) in matters
      that affect his home and community.  In 2020 he filed an Article 78
      proceeding (case number <strong>EFCA20205001843</strong>) challenging administrative
      actions that he believed infringed upon his rights as a disabled
      homeowner.  This page summarises his journey and provides resources for
      others navigating similar processes.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color:#a780e2; margin-top:2rem;">Background</h3>
    <p>
      Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules allows citizens to
      challenge decisions by state or local agencies.  Filing such a petition
      requires careful documentation and adherence to court rules.  Acting
      without an attorney (<em>pro se</em>), LaBarre prepared his own filings, drawing
      upon his experience with advocacy and the structured thinking behind his
      CBARL CSP protocol.  Though the specifics of the case are confidential,
      he emphasises the importance of persistence, clear communication and
      community support when confronting institutional barriers.

    <ul style="max-width:800px; margin:0 auto;">
      <li>For information on Article 78 proceedings, consult the
        <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/GoingToCourt/article78.shtml" target="_blank">New York Unified Court System’s guide</a> which explains how to
        commence a petition and what remedies are available.</li>
      <li>To explore LaBarre’s personal testimony and legal documentation,
        contact him directly via <a href="mailto:matthewlabarre@aol.com">email</a> or follow his updates on
        social media.  He occasionally shares redacted documents and
        reflections on the process.</li>
      <li>LaBarre’s legal work is an extension of his healing practice; he
        views law and sound as complementary means of restoring balance.  The
        <strong>ULS observational</strong> framework informs his approach by inviting
        deeper awareness of unseen forces—be they bureaucratic or energetic.</li>
